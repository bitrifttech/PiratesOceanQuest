# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices for 'Pirates of the Three Seas'. It has been written in everyday language to ensure that anyone, regardless of technical background, can understand how each technology contributes to the success of the project.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

The frontend is everything the player interacts with directly in their web browser. For this game, we chose modern and powerful web technologies:

*   **HTML**: The backbone of the game's structure, used to create the basic layout of the pages and interactive elements.
*   **CSS**: Provides styling and visual appeal, reflecting the classic pirate theme with deep blues, warm browns, and vintage fonts to establish the right mood.
*   **JavaScript**: Brings interactivity to the game, enabling controls, animations, and dynamic changes as players sail the open ocean.
*   **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library that makes rendering detailed 3D graphics in the browser easy. It is responsible for the engaging visuals, including the procedurally generated ocean, islands, and ship details.
*   **WebGL**: Works under the hood with Three.js to allow the game to use your computer's graphics hardware, ensuring smooth and responsive visuals even during intense naval battles.

These choices help deliver a smooth, visually immersive gaming experience in any modern web browser.

## 2. Backend Technologies

In this project, the backend is kept simple since the game runs entirely in your browser. Here's what we use:

*   **Local Storage**: Instead of relying on a full server-based backend, the game uses local storage in your browser to save progress, ship upgrades, and loot. This method is easy to implement and ideal for initial gameplay experiences.

This approach keeps the architecture simple and lets players jump right into the action without lengthy setup processes. In future updates, we might consider cloud-based saving for even greater flexibility and security.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

The game is designed as a web-based experience. To make sure everything works smoothly, we employ various tools and practices:

*   **Hosting Platforms**: The game is hosted on reliable web servers that ensure fast loading times and are optimized for 3D graphics. While the exact platform hasn't been specified, services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar options could be used.
*   **Version Control**: We use modern version control systems (like Git) to manage code changes, ensuring that development remains organized and any updates are easily integrated.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools help in testing and automatically deploying the game when updates are ready. This guarantees a stable and constantly improving experience for players.
*   **Development Tools & IDEs**: Tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable.dev, and Replit are used for coding, debugging, and collaboration. They provide real-time suggestions and make it easy for our team to work together effectively.

These infrastructure choices ensure the game is reliable, scalable, and easy to deploy across different environments.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

Third-party services and tools play a vital role in boosting the efficiency and capabilities of the project. Here are the key integrations:

*   **AI-Powered Coding Assistants**:

    *   Claude 3.5 Sonnet
    *   GPT o1
    *   Gemini 2.0 Flash

*   These tools help in streamlining coding and debugging processes, offering intelligent code suggestions and ensuring high-quality code.

*   **Advanced IDEs and Collaboration Platforms**:

    *   Cursor
    *   Windsurf
    *   Lovable.dev
    *   Replit

*   They provide real-time code suggestions, collaboration features, and a robust environment that enables rapid development and troubleshooting.

Such integrations ensure that our development process remains efficient and that we can quickly implement new features or debug issues.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Ensuring a secure and fast gaming experience is a top priority. Here’s how we manage it:

*   **Security Measures**:

    *   Since the game uses local storage, we make sure that no sensitive data is stored on the user's device. The game is designed to be safe for casual play without exposing vulnerabilities.
    *   Web technologies like Three.js and WebGL are used safely, adhering to recommended practices to avoid common security pitfalls.

*   **Performance Optimizations**:

    *   3D graphics rendering is optimized to ensure smooth gameplay, aiming for high frame rates (ideally 60 FPS) even during intense naval battles.
    *   The code is regularly profiled and optimized, ensuring that even the dynamic, procedurally generated ocean runs efficiently on a wide range of devices.
    *   Lightweight local storage usage ensures rapid load times and seamless game state management without lag.

These measures guarantee that players enjoy a secure, responsive, and immersive gaming experience.
