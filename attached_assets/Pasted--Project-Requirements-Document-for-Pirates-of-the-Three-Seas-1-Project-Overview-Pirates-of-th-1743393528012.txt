# Project Requirements Document for Pirates of the Three Seas

## 1. Project Overview

Pirates of the Three Seas is a browser-based, 3D pirate adventure game that offers players an easy-to-pick-up yet engaging naval combat experience. In the game, you control a single pirate ship sailing across a vast, procedurally generated ocean, engaging enemy pirate ships in action-packed battles. The game focuses on simple mechanics such as steering your ship, broadside cannon fire, and initiating boarding actions to capture or sink enemy vessels. With a blend of exploration, combat, and ship upgrades, the game creates an immersive and continuously evolving maritime adventure.

The primary purpose of this game is to offer a fun and accessible pirate-themed experience without getting bogged down by overly complex controls or strategies. By emphasizing straightforward gameplay—fast-paced naval battles, dynamic encounters, and meaningful progression—the game aims to satisfy players looking for casual yet deep pirate adventures directly within their web browsers. Success will be measured by player engagement, user satisfaction with smooth controls, and the replayability driven by procedural ocean generation and progressive ship upgrades.

## 3. User Flow

When a player loads Pirates of the Three Seas in their web browser, they are first greeted by a themed title screen that exudes a classic pirate feel using deep blues, warm browns, and vintage fonts. This entry point offers clear interactive buttons for "Start Game," "Settings," and "Help." Using simple controls (keyboard, mouse, or touch), the user can easily navigate the menu options and begin their adventure with minimal hassle.

After selecting "Start Game," the user is transitioned to a straightforward main menu where they can manage their ship customization, view local saved progress, or adjust settings. Once the gameplay begins, players find themselves immersed in a vast, procedurally generated ocean dotted with islands and dynamic weather. During their journey, they encounter enemy ships, maneuver their vessel to attack with cannons, and, when given the chance, initiate boarding actions using a designated button. Post-battle, players enter an upgrade menu to improve ship capabilities, providing continuous feedback and a robust, looping gameplay experience.
